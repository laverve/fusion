# pixi-fusion - The lightweight Game Engine

This project aims to provide a frwmework for games built on top of [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) and [matter-js](https://brm.io/matter-js/).

It is designed to be used with [React](https://react.dev/) framework v18.2.0 or above.

# Installation

```
npm i --save pixi-fusion
```

# Basic Usage Example

1. Create a component with `GameContextProvider` and `World`.

```
<GameContextProvider timeout={10}>
    <World size={{width: 300, height: 300}} eventMode="dynamic">
        <layer>
            <MyAwesomeStage />
        </Layer>
    </World>
</GameContextProvider>
```

2. Create a component `MyAwesomeStage`.

```
export const MyAwesomeStage: React.FC<MazeHeroProps> = () => {
    const { status } = useGame();
    const displayObjectConfig = useMemo(
        () => ({
            type: DisplayObjectType.SPRITE,
            url: "https://image_url",
            anchor: { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 },
        }),
        []
    );

    const [position, setPosition] = useState({x: 0, y: 0});

    useDisplayObject({
        ...displayObjectConfig,
        position: position
    });

    const onKeyDown = useCallback(
        (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
            switch (e.key) {
                case "ArrowUp":
                    setPosition({x: position.x, y: position.y - 1})
                    break;
                case "ArrowDown":
                    setPosition({x: position.x, y: position.y + 1})
                    break;
                case "ArrowRight":
                    setPosition({x: position.x + 1, y: position.y})
                    setDirection(90);
                    break;
                case "ArrowLeft":
                    setPosition({x: position.x - 1, y: position.y})
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
        },
        [position]
    );

    useGlobalEventHandler({ event: "keydown", callback: onKeyDown, isEnabled: status === GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS });

    return null;
};
```
